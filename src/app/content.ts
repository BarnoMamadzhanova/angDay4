    description2: `Architecture is one of the most universal practices that exists since it is present in every single one of our lives and, at the same time, it is as personal as it can get: our space is a representation of our culture, our story and of our personality. It is a representation of who we are, what constitutes us and where we come from. There is not a single home that is built and decorated exactly like another one, and that is the beauty of it. Architecture takes part in everyone’s life, but never in the same shape or form.`,
    description3: `An example of how architecture and photography complement each other is demonstrated with César’s work. This multidisciplinary creator has been able to combine his two passions, architecture and photography, which he discovered at a very young age, in a simultaneous and reciprocal way where one feeds from the other.
    “Founder of his own photography and interior design studio in 2015, the architect born in Guadalajara (Mexico) has developed a career based on this dual practice.” On one side, his architectural work is a contemporary expression of the Mexican tradition that is so deeply rooted in his essence. Whereas he defines his work as an architect as simple, structured and empirical, as a photographer he is an admirer of nature and its wilderness. Though it may seem paradoxical, it is not.`,

    description2: `Not many things possess the same level of constancy as the landscape of my region. The farthest expanses have remained unaltered since the first time I saw them. The idiosyncrasy lies in the fact that its pace is much slower than I am capable of appreciating, our relationship works because of that. It remains the same while I tend to be changing.`,
    description3: `As a child, I savored the mountains and meadows of my Basque Country. Many of my memories are with my aunt, my sister, and my cousins, as we explored small villages or walked along the cliffside routes that border our coast. Back then, the flowers still towered above our waist. It was boundless, akin to the playground – a place devoid of commitment to immerse oneself.
    Over the past decade, prolonged absences have punctuated our connection, with some intervals extending beyond a year. However, it reserves a spot on a cliff where I know every tree and the paths that lead me back to it. I have delved into it through its details, colors, textures and scenery in photographs, writings, and shared experiences. Perhaps it’s this ongoing endeavor that ensures it never truly ends. Is an inattentive and distracted interlocutor, and that’s the kind of relationship it offers.`,

    description2: `We meet on 15 July, 2023, to celebrate the traditional Venetian Festa del Redentore or Feast of the Redeemer, which takes place every third Sunday in July to commemorate the end of the plague that struck the city from 1575 to 1577. Vincenzo and Claudia Rose De Cotiis will take part in the procession, walking to the Church of Il Redentore in Giudecca.`,
    description3: `They live the city by personally immersing themselves in it, entranced by the history and culture that make it a unique open-air museum. It is a happy encounter between the De Cotiis’s outlook and the spirit of Venice, a porous merging of worlds that manifests itself in a harmonious balance of tradition and contemporaneity within the private abode that the designer has created on the first floor, or piano nobile, of Palazzo Giustinian Lolin. The palazzo, in the sestiere, or neighbourhood, of San Marco is also home to the Ugo and Olga Levi Foundation for music studies.
    Murano glass chandeliers, decorated ceiling beams, terrazzo floors and carved burl-walnut doors are a peep into the past lives of this building – elements that are now in the private residence of the De Cotiis family. This architect-artist has created layers of time, each one marked by its own style, and has enhanced the intrinsic beauty of the past by breathing new life into this imposing dwelling via the unique language of his artworks.`,

    description2: `When executing any form of art, the personality and the experiences of the artist are intrinsically present. Whether it is in the inspiration or in the actual tangible representation of the work itself, the artist’s essence is there. It can be painting, sculpture, music, literature, photography… Any artistic discipline you can imagine holds within it the nature of its creator, expressing it in different forms. In fact, that’s the uniqueness of art: it’s so intimate and personal, but at the same time, it’s public and exposed.`,
    description3: `When I ask Paul Bik how his art represents his personality, the response is clear: “I see my work as a direct reflection of who I am as a person, of how my personality is”. The artist born in Warsaw but based in Milan is inspired by the combination of opposites, and that inspiration comes from within: “My personality, with its duality and constant balancing between being an introvert and the need for expression, is present at every stage of my creative process”.
    That continuous balancing between contrasts is exactly what Paul Bik’s art explores. He finds harmony in opposites, and his art is a result of the combination between geometry and distortion, mathematical precision and intuitive finishing touches, traditional craftsmanship and new techniques. Working mostly with wood, cardboard, resin, plaster, and paint, one can’t seem to locate exactly what his art consists of. The artist himself can’t define it: “It would be difficult for me to classify my works as either sculpture or painting”, he expresses, “both the process of building a spatial form and the process of painting are equally essential to me, and I cannot imagine one without the other”.`,

    description2: `I have always thought that a house is more than just a structure. The identity of a place transcends time. It is defined by the objects composing it and the people to whom these objects belong. It is a reflection of those who inhabit it or transformed it. Historical houses have something special by the many lives imprinted on them over the years, recognising a space and making it shine again, requires individuals with a truly distinct perception.`,
    description3: `While looking at houses online, one of his favorite pastimes, Andrew Trotter stumbled upon a gem located in the region of Salento, Puglia. “It was charming. The façade had all the baroque details of a small palazzo and inside it felt like time stood still”.
    Being over 400 years old, the house hadn’t been lived in for over two decades, so more than an investment, it became a personal challenge for its new owners and the journey began regardless of the obstacles ahead. Taking into account that Andrew is co-founder and editor of Openhouse, I was aware that he, together with Marcelo Martínez, were renovating a house in Puglia, but when I saw the result of the project I had seen them working on for the past two years, it really captivated my soul in every way.
    The path to transform the old frame into Casa Soleto was far from straightforward as they faced the twists and turns of the house’s natural state. When Andrew showed me photos of their firsts visits, I perceived how impressive is the achieved balance between preserving the original historical structure while infusing modern features. This was a challenge accomplished, arguably the most significant of all the process for them.`,

    description2: `Perched on the banks of the River Po in the city of Turin, is the perfectly preserved Casa Mollino. A treasure trove of ideas, objects, patterns and colour, the lavish apartment designed by the architect-designer-photographer, Carlo Mollino, offers an insight into the machinations of the man himself, a veritable 20th century polymath.`,
    description3: `Technically-minded and unfailingly meticulous, Mollino’s approach, the way in which he viewed the world, led him to a career in the arts; driven by a desire to understand and unpick, each facet of his life – architecture, design, photography, aerobatics, skiing, race car driving – was an opportunity to arrive at an elegant and efﬁcient solution, a fully comprehensive theory. Coalescing around speed and aerodynamics, engineering and artistry, Mollino’s interests reﬂected those of the time, a period in which Futurism and technological progress were in the ascendant.
    As both an architect and product designer, Mollino was committed to modernism. In his ﬁrst apartment, he installed a sophisticated kinetic light that consisted of a serpentine track that snaked across the ceiling, along which a single pendant light could be drawn, bringing illumination to wherever it was most needed. The slick, minimal shaping of the acclaimed ‘Fenis’ chair (1959) has a lightweight construction that looks simultaneously architectural and organic; and his ‘Teatro Regio’, completed at the end of his life in 1973, has a rich, cinematic quality thanks to the grandeur and precision of its composition.`,
